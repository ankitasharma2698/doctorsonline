    <p>Coronary angiography is a procedure that uses a special dye (contrast material) and x-rays to see how blood flows through the arteries in your heart.
How the Test is Performed
Coronary angiography is often done along with cardiac catheterization. This is a procedure which measures pressures in the heart chambers.
Before the test starts, you will be given a mild sedative to help you relax.
An area of your body (the arm or grain) is cleaned and numbed with a local numbing medicine (anesthetic). The cardiologist passes a thin hollow tube, called a catheter, through an artery and carefully moves it up into the heart. X-ray images help the doctor position the catheter.
Once the catheter is in place, dye (contrast material) is injected into the catheter. X-ray images are taken to see how the dye moves through the artery. The dye helps highlight any blockages in blood flow.
The procedure most often lasts 30 to 60 minutes.
