    <p>
       Robotic cardiac surgery is heart surgery done through very small cuts in the chest. With the use of tiny instruments and robot-controlled tools, surgeons are able to do heart surgery in a way that is much less invasive than open-heart surgery. The procedure is sometimes called da Vinci surgery because that is the name of the manufacturer of the robot often used for this procedure.
 
Robotic surgeries have been used for a number of different heart-related procedures, including valve surgery, coronary artery bypass, cardiac tissue ablation, heart defect repair, and tumor removal.
Why might I need robotic cardiac surgery?
The main benefit of robotic cardiac surgery is that it is minimally invasive compared with open-heart surgery. Smaller incisions mean that you can heal faster and return to activities more quickly.
Your healthcare provider may recommend robotic cardiac surgery if you need an artery bypass procedure to improve blood flow to the heart. It may also be used to:
•	Repair or replace stiff or leaky heart valves
•	Correct atrial fibrillation, a common type of arrhythmia
 
•	Remove a tumor in the heart
•	Treat congenital heart conditions.
